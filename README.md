# Project Ideas!

Here's a list of project ideas that would be fun to do!

* Write a Lisp interpreter (any language - maybe Scala?)
  * Stage 2: Rewrite the Lisp interpreter in Lisp and upgrade to self hosting! 
* Use Rust to compile a basic Lisp language to WebAssembly
  * [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-bytecode-virtual-machine.html) Bytecode Virtual Machine section would be helpful for this
* Finish your Clojure [Automata](https://github.com/mjftw/automata) project, adding the Push Down Automata implementation
* Use Go to write the map-reduce program from the [MIT Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) course
  * More generally, complete the course
* Write an actor model based implementation of distributed map-reduce using Elixir
* Use SQL to write a convolutional neural network - Is it even possible?
* Implement some graph algorithms, using the [Graph Algorithms book](https://neo4j.com/graph-algorithms-book/) as reference
* Use Go to implement some algorithms from [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)
* Write an 8-bit 80s arcade game clone such as Tetris or Breakway.
  * [Other ideas here](https://www.ranker.com/list/best-80s-arcade-games/video-games-lists)
* Write an arcade style maze game where the maps are generated and the player walks around them to the goal. Could also add maze solvers.
  * Use [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers/) as a reference
* Work through the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course and refresh Electronics knowledge
